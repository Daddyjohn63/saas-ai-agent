/**
 * useConfirm Hook
 *
 * A powerful and reusable hook that creates a confirmation dialog with a Promise-based API.
 * This hook is particularly useful for actions that require user confirmation before proceeding,
 * such as deletions, expensive operations, or actions that can't be undone.
 *
 * Key benefits:
 * 1. Promise-based API makes it easy to use with async/await
 * 2. Encapsulates all dialog state management
 * 3. Provides a consistent confirmation UX across the application
 * 4. Responsive design works on both desktop and mobile
 * 5. Fully accessible with keyboard navigation
 *
 * Usage example:
 * ```tsx
 * const [ShowConfirm, confirm] = useConfirm("Delete item?", "This cannot be undone");
 *
 * const handleDelete = async () => {
 *   const confirmed = await confirm();
 *   if (confirmed) {
 *     // Proceed with deletion
 *   }
 * };
 * ```
